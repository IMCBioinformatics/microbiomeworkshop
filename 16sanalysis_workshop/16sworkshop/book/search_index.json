These samples are from a study looking at the effect of a prebiotic on the gut microbiota of children with type 1 diabetes. To invesigate this, the researchers took samples at three timepoints (baseline, 3 months, and 6 months) and sequenced the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. 6.2 Task 1 The first step with all sequence data is to ensure the primers have been removed. The two most common tools to accomplish this are Cutadapt and Trimmomatic. Note: both of these tools can be used for quality trimming as well as primer removal but here we will perform the quality trimming in dada2 instead. 6.2.1 Cutadapt You can find the documentation for this tool here. These are the parameters that contain the primer sequences: -g : forward primer -G : reverse primer -a : reverse primer, reverse complement -A : forward primer, reverse complement For this dataset, these are the appropriate primers: -g TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG -G GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC -a GGATTAGATACCCBDGTAGTCCTGTCTCTTATACACATCTCCGAGCCCACGAGAC -A CTGCWGCCNCCCGTAGGCTGTCTCTTATACACATCTGACGCTGCCGACGA Here is an example of how to execute Cutadapt from the command line: cutadapt -g &lt;sequence&gt; -G &lt;sequence&gt; -a &lt;sequence&gt; -A &lt;sequence&gt; -o output_forward.fastq -p output_reverse.fastq input_forward.fastq input_reverse.fastq Note that you can also run cutadapt from within R. You can find instructions on how to do that here. 6.2.2 Trimmomatic You can find the documentation for this tool here. Instead of specifying forward and reverse reads, Trimmomatic takes a fasta file as input and searches the reads for all sequences in the files. When using Trimmomatic on paired-end reads, you will get four output files: forward and reverse reads that are still paired (reads for which both forward and reverse were kept) and forward and reverse reads that are unpaired. In general, the number of unpaired reads should be small and you can continue with your analysis without these. For this dataset, you can use this fasta. Here is an example of how to execute Trimmomatic from the command line: trimmomatic PE input_forward.fq.gz input_reverse.fq.gz output_forward_paired.fq.gz output_forward_unpaired.fq.gz output_reverse_paired.fq.gz output_reverse_unpaired.fq.gz ILLUMINACLIP:v3v4primers.fa:2:30:10:2:keepBothReads LEADING:0 TRAILING:0 MINLEN:0 6.2.3 Primers removed If you donâ€™t care about using either of these tools and want to move on to the next step, you can find the sequences with the primers removed here. 6.3 Task 2 Use the dada2 pipeline to generate a table of ASVs and a taxonomy table. Plot quality profiles of the reads for all samples. Save these as pdf files. Try a couple of sets of filtering params and determine the best choice. Filter and trim the data and generate the quality plots again. Save these as well. Learn the error rates and visually inspect the estimated error rates. Infer samples. Merge paired reads. Construct sequence table. Remove chimeras. Track reads through the pipeline and ensure that no step of the analysis removed a large/unreasonable proportion of the reads. Assign taxonomy using the Silva databse. Save the ASV table and taxonomy table using the saveRDS() function. 6.4 Task 3 Use the phyloseq package to generate do some basic analysis. For this section you will need the metadata. Generate a histogram of the number of reads per sample. Does this look okay? Generate a table of alpha diversity measures (Shannon, Simspon, and Chao1) and use this table to plot alpha diversity by treatment and timepoint. Transform the data to relative abundances and remove ASVs that are only present in less than 5% of the samples. Perform a principal component analysis (PCoA) using the ordinate() function and distance = &quot;bray&quot;. Plot beta diversity. Explore the composition of each sample by generating bar plots of the relative abundances at the level of phylum, family, and genus. For family and genus, plot only the top 10 most abundant taxa. "]
